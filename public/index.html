      <p>I am a Software Engineer and a Automation and Control(Mechatronics) Engineer.
Besides that I am a big entusiast of Open-Source and Linux systems.</p>
<p>During my graduation, I worked on researching projects with Rockwell PLCs,
designing and implementing automation and control algorithms in Structured Text,
Ladder, and Function Blocks.</p>
<p>In 2011 I started working with low level languages, notably C/C ++ and Assembly.
Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my knowledge of languages and
paradigms, incorporating new concepts such as OOP and Real Time Programming,
always aiming for code quality and commitment to best-practices.</p>
