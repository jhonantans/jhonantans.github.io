						Fullstack Developer, Automation and Control Engineer (Mechatronics) and computer science enthusiast. During my graduation, I worked on research with Rockwell PLCs, designing and implementing control algorithms in Structured Text, Ladder, and Function Blocks. In 2011 I started working with low level languages, notably C/C ++ and Assembly. Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my knowledge of languages ​​and paradigms, incorporating new concepts such as OOP and Real Time Programming and always aiming for code quality and commitment to best-practices. In 2014, I joined the football team of humanoid robots UnBeatables, representing my university in the robotics competition, Robocup. Since 2016 I am a developer on the team of Moringa Digital, one of the largest online advertising companies and web systems in Brasilia. Since then, I have focused on mobile development using the latest hybrid tools such as Ionic 2, Cordova and IntelXDK. As a fullstack developer, my responsibilities range from database planning to user interface implementation, server programming, API development and mobile application delivery.

							<h4>Researcher (Academic Research)</h4>
							<p><b> University of Brasilia (UnB)</b><br/><b>2014 - 2016</b></p>
							<p class="text-justify">Development and application of Fuzzy controllers, based on the Takagi-Sugeno method (TS), to an industrial-level plant controlled by a Rockwell CLP. The non-linear mathematical modeling of the Four-Tanks system and its linearization were developed during the research. The method proposed by TS was then applied, elaborating the Fuzzy model of the system, an approximation as precise as one wants of the real plant and of simple manipulation in computational terms. From this model, the systematic design of controllers via LMIs was carried out. In order to obtain a null error in the steady-state regime, a Proportional Integral (PI) control was obtained, based on the  state space of the model plus the integral channels of the error of the controlled outputs.
							A Rockwell PLC (1756-L62) has been installed and integrated into the bench along with the input and output data modules used. This was followed by integration with the development software (RSLogix, RSLinx, Matlab) and the communication configurations between them. TS models were simulated and their validated projected efficiency, as well as the controllers developed from them. Finished with the implementation of the closed loop in the controller, through Structured Text and Function Blocks, and project validation. </p>
