# About

I am a Software Engineer, Automation and Control Engineer (Mechatronics) and a
linux and computer science enthusiast.

During my graduation, I worked on researching projects with Rockwell PLCs,
designing and implementing control algorithms in Structured Text, Ladder, and
Function Blocks.

In 2011 I started working with low level languages, notably C/C ++ and Assembly.
Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my knowledge of languages ​and
paradigms, incorporating new concepts such as OOP and Real Time Programming,
always aiming for code quality and commitment to best-practices.

In 2014, I joined the football team of humanoid robots UnBeatables, representing
my university in the robotics competition, Robocup.

From 2016 to 2017 I am a developer on the team of Moringa Digital, one of the largest
online advertising companies and web systems in Brasilia. ThereI have focused on
mobile development using the latest hybrid tools such as Ionic 2, Cordova and IntelXDK.

As a fullstack developer, my responsibilities range from database planning to
user interface implementation, server programming, API development and mobile
application delivery.
