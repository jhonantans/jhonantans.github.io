# About

I am a Software Engineer and a Automation and Control(Mechatronics) Engineer.
cesides that I am a big entusiast of Open-Source and Linux systems.

During my graduation, I worked on researching projects with Rockwell PLCs,
designing and implementing automation and control algorithms in Structured Text,
Ladder, and Function Blocks.

In 2011 I started working with low level languages, notably C/C ++ and Assembly.
Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my knowledge of languages and
paradigms, incorporating new concepts such as OOP and Real Time Programming,
always aiming for code quality and commitment to best-practices.

In 2014, I joined the football team of humanoid robots UnBeatables, representing
my university in the robotics competition, Robocup.

From 2016 to 2018 I was part am a developer on the team of Moringa Digital, one
of the largest online advertising companies and web systems in Brasilia. There
I was fullstack developer, my responsibilities ranging from database planning to
user interface implementation, server programming, API development and mobile
application delivery.

During 2018 I worked on Metrópoles, a major online news platform in Brasil. The
critical point of the role was maintenance and high availability of a php(wordpress)
structure and its APIs.

Since ending 2018 I have been part of BairesDev teams, focusing on Node APIs and
its AWS structure.
