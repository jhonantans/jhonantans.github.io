# Hi there! ðŸ––
I am Jhon, a software and automation engineer. Currently I am mostly focused on Node.js, working in backend services and applications. 

You can find me at anytime on my [github](https://github.com/jhonrocha), where I spend most of time ricing my Arch Linux and Vim configs and also learning by practicing Rust, Python and AWS.

Contact me by [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhonantans-moraes-rocha-949051105/) or [email](jhmrocha@gmail.com). Bellow you can find my resume in english and in portuguÃªs (yeap, I am from Brasil xD).
