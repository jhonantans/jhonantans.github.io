# Hi there! ðŸ––
I am Jhon, a software and automation engineer. Currently I am mostly focused on Node.js and AWS, working in backend services and applications. 

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhonantans-moraes-rocha-949051105/), [email](jhmrocha@gmail.com) and [github](https://github.com/jhonrocha), where I spend most of time ricing my Arch Linux and Vim configs and also learning by practicing Rust, Python and AWS.

Bellow you can find my resume in english and in portuguÃªs (yeap, I am from Brasil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).
